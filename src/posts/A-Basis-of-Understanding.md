# Basis of Understanding
### First post / old content:

Humanity is undergoing constant change and transformation upon an unending quest to comprehend the intricacies of what we commonly refer to as reality. Central to philosophical inquiry is the pursuit of defining the very nature of reality, existence, and being. Equally crucial is the contemplation of the outcomes that arise in response to our attempts to encapsulate these concepts within finite definitions, for in doing so, we assert our supposed knowledge of them.

There is a profound interplay between ontological and epistemological methods of investigation. These two approaches are intrinsically intertwined, each reliant on the other for its own existence. Paradoxically, they appear to exist in opposition—how can we question the existence of something if we possess unwavering knowledge about it? Conversely, if we harbor uncertainty regarding its existence, how can we claim comprehensive understanding? True and comprehensive knowledge would seemingly eliminate any doubts about the existence of a given phenomenon. On the other hand, we often find ourselves questioning the very existence of things that remain shrouded in partial understanding...

...we are compelled to ask: What can truly be known? What possesses authentic being? And how does the intricate relationship between ontological and epistemological frameworks serve as the key to answering these fundamental questions?

The basis of understanding lies in recognizing that this very relationship holds the power to define the nature of reality, rather than subscribing exclusively to either extreme as wholly valid or false. It is the interplay between existence and knowledge, the dynamic fabric that gives rise to generative processes. While the two polarized aspects of this relationship bear significance, their unifying nature surpasses their individual import. This relational nexus precedes the resulting facets, perpetually shaping their interaction—it is both a priori, preceding knowledge, and a posteriori, arising as a consequence of it.

​It is essential to emphasize that this perspective does not imply the unattainability of knowledge, the illusory nature of existence, or the elusive nature of truth. Truth resides within established knowledge, which emerges from the ever-evolving nature of reality. Our reality is never caught in a state of absolute flux or complete stasis—it defies confinement to any particular time or place, eternally shaping itself. It encompasses all times, all places, and remains ever-present.
